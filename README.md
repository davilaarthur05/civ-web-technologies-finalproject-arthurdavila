In this project, a series of steps needs to be completed to create my own "mobile first", responsive, Portfolio Website.

In the steps that are contained in this document, I will have to design several pages, create the layout for the pages & use version controlled as I progress.

These steps include:

* Initial project setup;
* Version control;
* Wireframe designs;
* Use of imagery;
* HTML, CSS & JavaScript;
* Use of Tailwind;
* Test HTML is displayed as expected using at least two different browsers with different web rendering engines;
* Publish the site on GitHub pages.
